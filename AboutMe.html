         <p class="greetings">Hello Everyone! Alex here! I am a young artist from iowa. I've spent learning
            the craft from experienced artists that I admire. I have spent four years of professional training,
            but it's a skilled built throughout my entire life. My inspiration comes from Claud√© Monet, Piccaso, Tim
            Burton,
            Hayao Miyazaki and many others.</p>

        <h3>Description of work</h3>
        <p id="art-description" class="art-description"> Commonly, elements of surrealism, texture and color
            stand out in my
            most current work. I specialize in acrylic painting, drawing, and collage making. The content as of late
            have been personal projects, but I am open to exploring portrait work or illustration in the future.</p>
